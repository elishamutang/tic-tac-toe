# tic-tac-toe
Tic Tac Toe project from The Odin Project's JavaScript course

This branch was created to test out an alternative way of approaching this project.

- Experimenting with factory functions instead of using IIFE at this stage.


Objectives:

1. Create working game in console (technically almost done)
2. Set up reset method to reset round when a winner is found. (done)
3. Create function to render the game on the webpage (next)

To keep in mind:

1. Come up with efficient solution for checkForWinner logic
