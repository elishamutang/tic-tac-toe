# tic-tac-toe
Tic Tac Toe project from The Odin Project's JavaScript course

This branch was created to test out a DOM handler function to handle the display/DOM logic.

It will:
- Render the contents of the gameboard array to the webpage

Progress (as of 12/12):
- Code allows DOM to be updated based on user input from the console.
- Introduced a restart button to restart game when a round finishes.
- Users able to insert names and click on gameboard.

What's next:
- Fix logic between DOM and gameflow.
