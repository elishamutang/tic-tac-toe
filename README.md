# tic-tac-toe
Tic Tac Toe project from The Odin Project's JavaScript course

This branch was created to test out a DOM handler function to handle the display/DOM logic.

It will:
- Render the contents of the gameboard array to the webpage

Progress (as of 9/12):
- Code allows DOM to be updated based on user input from the console.
- Introduced a restart button to restart game when a round finishes.

What's next:
- Next focus is to allow users to click on the gameboard to place their choice.
- Allow users to enter names
